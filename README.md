# Curb Data Specification

## Overview

Urban curb is a valuable, limited, and often under-managed part of the public right of way. Curb demand is growing, including from commercial activity like passenger pickup/drop off, traditional and on-demand delivery services, and goods and freight delivery. While cities have made some progress in digitizing their curb and using curb data, more tools are needed to proactively manage curbs and sidewalks, and in doing so deliver more public value from this scarce resource. Curb data standards can provide a mechanism for expressing static and dynamic regulations, measuring activity at the curb, and providing access and utilization for curb users.
