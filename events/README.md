# Curb Data Specification: Events API

The Events API is a REST API allowing real-time and historic events at the curb to be sent to cities, and the ability to check on the status of any sensors. Events can come from company data feeds, sensors, payments, check-ins, enforcement, and/or other city data sources. Data sent in the Events API can be connected to the Curbs API over time and space, and events are used for calcuations in the Metrics API. 

## âš  Beta
> **This feature is current a draft of the initial CDS beta release. It will change as development and real-world feedback happens.**

# Endpoints

There are two different endpoints that are part of the Events API:

  - A [Curb Event](#curb-event) is an activity that occurs near, at, or within a pre-defined curb area. Defining events is *required* as part of the Events API.
  - A [Status](#status) is the current status of a curb monitoring source. Event status is *optional*.

# REST Endpoints

All endpoints return a JSON object containing the following fields:

| Name   | Type   | Required/Optional   | Description   |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| `data` | _Endpoint-dependent_ | Required | The requested data objects. |
| `version` | String | Required | The specification version that the API conforms to (currently, `0.0`) |
| `time_zone` | String | Required | The time zone that applies to parking regulations in this dataset. MUST be a valid [TZ database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) time zone name (e.g. `"US/Eastern"` or `"Europe/Paris"`). |

| `author` | String | Optional | The name of the organization that produces and maintains this data. |
| `license_url` | URL | Optional | The licensing terms under which this data is provided. |

Servers MUST set the `Content-Type` header to `application/vnd.cds+json;version=0.0` to support
versioning in the future.  Clients SHOULD specify an `Accept` header containing 
`application/vnd.cds+json;version=0.0`. If the server receives a request that contains an `Accept`
header but does not include this value; it MUST respond with a status of `406 Not Acceptable`.

| `event_type`   | Description |
|----------------| ----------- |
| `comms_lost`   | communications with the event source were lost |

[Top][toc]

### Vehicle Type

Type of vehicle, similar to vehicle_type in MDS. For this CDS release the list will be developed independently here to accommodate CDS and MDS use cases, while still aligning to the MDS design principles.  In the next major MDS 2.0 release and next CDS release, alignment between CDS and MDS vehicle types can occur.

| `vehicle_type`   | Description |
|------------------| ----------- |
| `bicycle`        | A two-wheeled mobility device intended for personal transportation that can be operated via pedals, with or without a motorized assist (includes e-bikes, recumbents, and tandems) |
| `cargo_bicycle`  | A two- or three-wheeled bicycle intended for transporting larger, heavier cargo than a standard bicycle (such as goods or passengers), with or without motorized assist (includes bakfiets/front-loaders, cargo trikes, and long-tails) |
| `car`            | A passenger car or similar light-duty vehicle |
| `scooter`        | A standing or seated fully-motorized mobility device intended for one rider, capable of travel at low or moderate speeds, and suited for operation in infrastructure shared with motorized bicycles |
| `moped`          | A seated fully-motorized mobility device capable of travel at moderate or high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic |
| `motorcycle`     | A seated mobility device capable of travel at high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic or expressways |

| `van`            | A van with significant interior cargo space |
| `freight`        | A large delivery truck with attached cab |
| `other`          | A device that does not fit in the other categories |
| `unspecified`    | Unspecified |

### Propulsion Type

Propulsion type of the vehicle, similar to propulsion_type in MDS. For this CDS release the list will be developed independently here to accommodate CDS and MDS use cases, while still aligning to the MDS design principles.  In the next major MDS 2.0 release and next CDS release, alignment between CDS and MDS propulsion types can occur. 

| `propulsion`      | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `human`           | Pedal or foot propulsion                               |
| `electric_assist` | Provides power only alongside human propulsion         |
| `electric`        | Contains throttle mode with a battery-powered motor    |
| `combustion`      | Contains throttle mode with a gas engine-powered motor |

A vehicle may have one or more values from the `propulsion`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric']`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric_assist']` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle.
