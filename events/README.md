# Curb Data Specification: Events API

The Events API is a REST API allowing real-time and historic events at the curb to be sent to cities. Events can come from company data feeds, sensors, payments, check-ins, enforcement, and/or other city data. Data sent in the Events API can be connected to the Curbs API and then used for the Metrics API.
